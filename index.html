      <h1>Myles's Website</h1>
      <p>This is my first webpage and I am far below average in skill level.
          I don't really know what I'm doing but I'm sure I'll improve eventually. I really did try though and it took me a long time to learn the basics.</p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have multiple hobbies:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>I play volleyball</li>
      <li>I enjoy traveling</li>
      <li>I love ice skating and I used to play hockey</li>
      <li>I used to play a lot of video games, but not as much in school right now.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Topics I'm Interested in:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.space.com/">Space</a> </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/">Games</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm very excited for this, and upcoming, years in my major. I feel like it is going to be both interesting and challenging while highschoool was neither.
      I am longing to gather the skills needed to further my education and be able to do what I want with them. The fture in game design looks bright, all though their seem to be a lot more competitiors going into the field. This is another reason why I am so eager to gather skills before I graduate.</p>
